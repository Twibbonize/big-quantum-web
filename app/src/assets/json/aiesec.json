            "paragraph": "Being the National Head of Branding and Marketing of AIESEC, Millania Saliza finds Twibbonize to be very simple and easy to use. As AIESEC consists of 26 local communities, she explained how every local community would be given the liberty to choose their own way and method of campaigning, and the national team would only decide on the campaign idea, along with the brand guideline. Apparently, many of the local communities of AIESEC use Twibbonize as their go-to digital campaign platform."

            "paragraph": "Millania then explained how she and her team are used to making a frame picture manually, where everybody has to input and adjust their pictures in the frame manually. With Twibbonize, she is then able to make a digital campaign in a very convenient way, so it’s very practical. Not to mention that the campaign distribution is also perceived to be relatively easy, leaving their only task is to choose the picture, and you’ll have your Twibbon set up in no time."

            "paragraph": "In AIESEC’s most recent campaign, they uploaded their Twibbon with Instagram story ratio, to be utilized for their members to upload it on their Instagram story. For Millania, it is a good thing that Twibbonize can accommodate different preferences of their users, as it allows our users to be flexible in carrying out their campaign on Twibbonize."
